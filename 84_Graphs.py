Representation of Graphs 

1. Adjacency List - Mark the nodes with the list of its neighbors 

2. Adjaceny Matrix - Aij = 1 for an edge between i and j otherwise 0

Some other representations are Edge set , Cost Adjacency List , Compact list representation etc...
    

Graph Traversal - 

Graph Traversal refers to the process of visiting each vertex in a graph 

Two of the Graph Traversal Algorithims are - 

1. Breadth First Search BFS - uses Queue DS (First in First Out FIFO)
2. Depth First Search - uses Stack DS (Last in First Out LIFO)
