A Connected Subgraph S of a Grah G(V,E) can be a spanning tree of Graph G if -

    1. All the vertices/nodes of G is present in S
    2. No. of edges in S is equal to V-1

Cost of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree

A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with minimum cost
    
Spanning Trees for Complete Graphs -
    a complete graph G has n^(n-2) spanning trees where n is the no. of vertices in Graph G
