# Binary Tree 

"""
Binary Tree is a tree where each node has at most two chilrens, or a tree with a degree <= 2

A Tree is made up of edges and nodes, a tree is a non-linear data structure
A tree of n nodes has n-1 edges
root - main node or a node that doesn't have any parent
leaf node - node that does not have any child
Degree - no. of direct childs of a node 
Depth - no. of edges from root to the node
Height - no. of edges from the node to the leaf node  

Linear DS - array, stack , queue, linked list , Hash Table (can be represented linearly and non linearly)
Non Linear DS - Generally used to represent Hierarchical data - Trees, Graphs , Heaps , Hash Tables

# Types of Binary Trees

1. Full or Strict Binary Tree 
    - All nodes have either 0 or 2 children

2. Perfect Binary Tree 
    - Internal nodes have 2 children + all leaf nodes are on same level

3. Complete Binary Tree
    - All levels are completely filed except possibly the last level + last level must have its keys as left as possible

4. Degenerate Tree 
    - Every Parent node has exactly one child

    4.1 Skewed Binary Trees - left skewed & right skewed
