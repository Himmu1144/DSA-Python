# Analysing criterias for sorting algorithims

"""

1) Time complexity

2) Space Complexity - inplace sorting algorithims 

3) Stability - The elements in the sorted array maintainse the same order

arr1 = [1,4,2,5,1,9]
sorted arr1 = [1,1,2,4,5,9]

4) Internal Sorting Algo - All the data is loaded into the memory
   External Sorting Algo - All the data is not loaded into the memory

5) Adaptive - Already sorted data takes less time

6) Recursive/Non-Recursive Sorting Algos
